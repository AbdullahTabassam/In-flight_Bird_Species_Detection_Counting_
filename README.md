# In-flight Bird Species Detection and Counting

Welcome to the repository for the In-flight Bird Species Detection and Counting project! This project, developed as part of an MSc thesis, focuses on utilizing object detection models for the categorization, species detection, and counting of birds. By leveraging computer vision techniques, this project aims to contribute to wildlife conservation and research efforts.

## Overview

This project explores the use of object detection models to identify and categorize various bird species from photos. It includes two primary models: a specific bird species classifier capable of detecting six different bird species and a generic bird classifier categorizing all birds under one class - Birds. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Repository Contents

- **Thesis**: Find the detailed thesis document in the 'Thesis' folder.
- **Notebooks**: All Jupyter notebooks used in the project are available.
- **Code**: All code related to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, including the inference script 'inf.py', is available in the repository.
- **Models**: Trained models used in the project are present in the repository.
- **Images**: View detections on images in the 'images' folder.

## Key Features

- Utilizes fine-tuning of YOLOv8 model for accurate bird detection.
- Implements transfer learning for efficient model training.
- Evaluates models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provides visualizations including confusion matrices and precision-recall curves for better understanding of model performance.

## Practical Implications

The object-detection models developed in this project have significant practical implications for conservation and wildlife monitoring activities. By automating bird species identification, researchers can collect data at scale, contributing to a better understanding of bird populations and migration patterns.
